## How To Play

1.  You are given five rolls per turn. Tap on a die to lock it
2.  The number of dice locked must be equal to or greater than the
    roll you're on. So if it's roll #2, you need to have at least 2 dice locked
    to continue
3.  For the most points, you want the highest OR the lowest rolls
    possible. You decide!

4.  The ↑↓ die is special. You want "↑" if you're going for high
    rolls, or "↓" if you're going for low rolls. The number on this die
    multiplies your points, so you want 3x whenever possible!

5.  A perfect score is all 6s and x3↑ OR all 1s and x3↓

6.  The player with the highest score after 5 rounds wins!
